## Aim: 

To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering
creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of
large language models.

## Objective:

To demonstrate the development of a prompt-driven assistant for organizing daily
tasks, planning, or productivity-related functions. This includes progressing from
basic prompts to advanced, context-aware prompts that simulate real-world assistant
behaviors.

## Algorithm / Methodology:
## Step 1: Identify a Personal or Functional Need

Define the purpose of the application. Possible use cases include:

• Daily task planner

• Meal or fitness scheduler

• Study routine assistant

• Mental wellness check-in bot

• Writing or content creation helper

Selected Use Case: Daily Task Organizer

## Step 2: Define the Basic Functionality

Create a simple prompt to initiate task organization.

## Basic Prompt:

“Help me organize my tasks for today: buy groceries, complete homework, attend
meeting at 3 PM.”

## Expected Output:

• A bulleted or ordered task list

• Simple schedule layout based on given tasks

Incorporate user preferences, constraints, and desired style.

## Step 3: Refine the Prompt with More Context

Incorporate user preferences, constraints, and desired style.

## Refined Prompt:

“Organize these tasks into a daily schedule between 9 AM and 6 PM, including
breaks and priority order:

• Buy groceries

• Complete homework

• Attend meeting at 3 PM

I prefer to do creative tasks in the morning and errands after lunch.”

## Expected Output:

• A time-blocked schedule

• Consideration of personal work patterns and productivity rhythms

## Step 4: Add Smart Features via Prompt Expansion

Introduce adaptive behaviors such as suggestions, self-care, and motivational
support.

## Advanced Prompt:

“Based on my productivity preferences (creative tasks in the morning, physical
errands in the afternoon), generate a smart day plan from 9 AM to 6 PM with short
breaks every 90 minutes. Include motivational quotes before major tasks.

## Tasks:

• Finish presentation

• Grocery shopping

• Team meeting at 3 PM

• 30-minute walk”

## Expected Output:

• A motivational quote or message before big tasks

• A well-paced, context-aware schedule

• Breaks and self-care integrated into the plan

Structure the interaction to mimic how a user would engage with an actual app.

## Initial User Prompt:

“Create my task plan for the day.”

## Model Response:

“As a starting point, please list your tasks, your available time window, and how you
prefer to structure your day (e.g., focused work first, errands later).”

## Follow-up Prompt:

“Tasks: Write blog, dentist appointment at 2 PM, laundry.
Time: 10 AM – 5 PM.
Prefer writing early, and errands after.”

## Model Output:

• A time-sensitive, personalized daily plan

• Appointment allocation and buffer time management

## Step 6: Add Personalization for Reuse

Encourage reusable and customizable prompt templates that simulate memory and
routine.

## Reusable Prompt Template:

“Based on my previous schedule template, generate a day plan including the
following tasks: [tasks]. Use the usual format and include motivational tips.”

## Benefits:

• Acts as a pseudo-memory feature

• Enables consistent and efficient daily use

• Promotes user ownership of productivity style

## Conclusion:

This experiment demonstrates how large language models like ChatGPT can be
leveraged to build prompt-powered applications tailored to individual needs. By
iteratively refining prompts—from simple task lists to interactive and context-aware
daily planning—users can simulate digital assistant behavior without needing to
write code. This fosters creativity, critical thinking, and practical problem-solving skills.

## Result

The Prompt is executed successfully
